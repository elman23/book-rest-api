# Book REST API

Spring Boot project for Book REST API.

This project is very simple and it is intended to show some architectural and implementation practices.

Some practices:
- Use of Spring Boot.
- Use of JPA/Hibernate to handle database connection.
- Usage of JpaRepository as DAO layer.
- Separation of concerns: usage of Service layer to connect REST and DAO.
- Use of Spring Security with JDBC stored users/authorities.
- Hashing of database-saved passwords.
